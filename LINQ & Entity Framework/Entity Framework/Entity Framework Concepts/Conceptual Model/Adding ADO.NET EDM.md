After adding the Entity Data Model, our project will look like this:
![[Pasted image 20240929215201.png]]

`Model.Context.cs` is the context file that contains our database connections settings
```C#
using System;
using System.Data.Entity;
using System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure;

public partial class db_employeeEntitites : DbContext {
	public db_employeeEntities() : base("name=db_employeeEntities") {}

	protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder) {
		throw new UnintentionalCodeFirstException();
	}

	public virtual DbSet<EmployeeDetail> EmployeeDetails { get; set; }
}
```

`Model.cs` contains all the properties of the `EmployeeDetail` 
```C#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public partial class EmployeeDetail {
	public int EmpId { get; set; }
	public string EmpName { get; set; }
	public string Location { get; set; }
	public string Gender { get; set; }
}
```

Note: For every table which we will select from the database, a class file will be generated by the Entity Framework automatically
```C#
// Create the object of the Context defined in the constructor of the context class
db_employeeEntities db = new db_employeeEntities();

var result = from emp in db.EmployeeEntities {
	select new {
		Id = emp.EmpId,
		Name = emp.EmpName,
		Location = emp.Location,
		Gender = emp.Gender
	}
}
```
