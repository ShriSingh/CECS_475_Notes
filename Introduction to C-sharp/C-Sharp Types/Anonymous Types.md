Useful for creating an object containing a set of *read-only* properties
- Without specifying its type using `new` keyword
- Name and type for the properties in an anonymous type object is automatically generated by the compiler
- The reference of anonymous types can be held by `var` type variables
	- Need to declare `var` keyword to assign anonymous objects
		- `var userInfo = new { Id = 1, name = "Suresh", isActive = true };`
			- **Note:** value assigned to the property above *can't be null*
- Example:
```C#
static void Main(string[] args) {
....
}
```

[[var keyword]]
